- Add: Support for the `XR_EXT_hand_tracking_data_source` extension.
- Add: `OXR_HAND_TRACKING_PRIORITIZE_CONFORMING` debug environment variable. When enabled, prioritizes the conforming hand-tracking source over the unobstructed source when both are active. This is useful for debugging or forcing controller-based hand poses.
- Change: Differentiated the hand-tracking device role and `xrt_input_name` into two distinct types: **`unobstructed`**, for standard hand-tracking where the hand is free, and **`conforming`**, for hand-tracking where a held object (e.g., a controller) obstructs full finger motion. This change allows for more flexible device configurations, supporting either a single `xrt_device` for both roles or separate devices for each.
