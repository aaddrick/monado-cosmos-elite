- Change: In `oxr_session_update_action_bindings`, change the selection priority for dynamic roles to prioritize the device name
- Fix: Bug where `interaction_profile_find_in_session` would return unconditionally after finding the first profile. When multiple profiles share a name (e.g., `touch_plus` in both `XR_META_touch_controller_plus` and the OpenXR 1.1 core spec), only the first was ever considered.
